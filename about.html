      <h1>About Page</h1>

      My website is designed to demonstrate some fundamental shader techniques. This is done through letting users apply various shader effects onto three models that I have created.

      <div class="aboutPageMainText">
        <!-- 3D MODELS SECTION -->
        <h2  class="aboutPageSubTitles">3D Models</h2>
        <h3>Spaceship</h3>
        The first model is based generally on popular notions of flying saucers but also specifcally on one particular example. In the MMO, "Final Fantasy XIV" there is a sequence of comedic questlines which includes an 
        encounter with aliens. They fly the ship pictured below.

        <div class="aboutPageCenter">
          <img class = "aboutPageImage" src="public/pupus-ufo.jpg" alt="A UFO from FFXIV">
          <div>
            <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-14-xiv-ufo-mount-hildibrand-quest-guide/">Image Source</a>
          </div>
        </div>  

        The metalic texture of the hull and the emissive thrusters on the bottom are reflected in my model. My website includes an animation for each model and for the UFO it involves the opening of the dome.
        Inside is a simplistic control room, if I wanted to improve this model I could add some lights or other animated elements to this interior.

        <h3>Skull</h3>
        The Skull model draws inspiration from two primary sources, video games "Devil Daggers" and "Waltz of the Wizard". "Devil Daggers" uses a very pixelated and low poly style, one which has been mimicked in my model.
        
        <div class="aboutPageCenter">
          <img class = "aboutPageImage" src="public/devilDaggers.png" alt="One of the types of Skull enemies from Devil Daggers">

          </div>
        </div>  
        
        Unlike my other models (which use a mix of mostly singular colours and some textures), the Skull uses only textures (made by me in a program called Aseprite), as a result this was by far the hardest model to make. It took
        longer than both other models combined by a significant margin (around 6 to 8 hours, including the time spent learning how to properly create useful UVs).

        The animation was added retroactively, when I made the model I had no specific animation in mind. Originally the model had more pixelated eyes, that were part of the texture, which I removed to add the more cartoony eyes
        inspired by "Waltz of the Wizard". This game features a skull character that acts as an assistant, he is pictured below.

        <div class="aboutPageCenter">

            <a href="https://x.com/AldinDynamics/status/1899872625725497817">Image Source</a>
          </div>
        </div> 

        <h3>Totoro</h3>
        The final model is, of course, based on the famous movie character but more specifically, a small plush of him I've owned for several years, pictured below.

        <div class="aboutPageCenter">
          <img class = "aboutPageImage" src="public/totoro.jpg" alt="My Totoro plush">
          <div>
            <a>(Photo taken by me)</a>
          </div>
        </div> 

        Much like the spaceship, this model only uses a single texture, in this case for the triangle shapes on the belly. Its animation involves a simplistic wave combined with a couple extra details (ears twitching, eyes blinking)
        to make it look cuter/more lifelike.

        <!-- EFFECTS SECTION -->
        <h2 class="aboutPageSubTitles">Visual Effects</h2>

        The demonstratory effects I've included are listed below, alongside a brief explanation of how I believe they demonstrate shader techniques.
        <br>
        1. Value. Used to demonstrate the fundamental value (or average of all the colours) of a given pixel.
        <br>
        2. Pixelation. Used to demonstrate how you can manipulate UV coords to produce effects. In this case rounding UV coords to a cell center.

        <!-- DESIGN SECTION -->
        <h2 class="aboutPageSubTitles">Design</h2>

        I used Bootstrap to handle the layout of my html elements. A canvas, which threejs uses as a render target, is placed behind everything, set to fill the full resolution of the window. Every other element is then placed on top of that. This unintentionally
        created a usability issue as divs naturally blocked mouse events to the canvas, even if they were invisible. The issue was quickly fixed after it was revealed by user testing,
        however, any element that needs to handle mouse events now needs to be tagged explicitly.
        <br>        <br>
        In general, I utilize a minimalist approach to design. The only colour in the website is used to differentiate and highlight the types of buttons. My "About" link is placed at the bottom of the page, intentionally removed
        from the design (and placement) of the other buttons.

        <!-- INTEGRATION SECTION -->
        <h2 class="aboutPageSubTitles">Integration</h2>

        Alongside the models, I've also added some audio elements. All the onclick events for every button, also calls a "playButtonClick" function, to add some additional feedback for the user. This is especially important
        for cases where effects (mostly the "Value" effect on the first two models) don't necessarily have a visible impact.

        <!-- INTERACTION SECTION -->
        <h2 class="aboutPageSubTitles">Interaction</h2>

        To help with viewing the models, I utilize the "OrbitControls" addon for threejs. This provides a basic orbiting camera, controlled similarly to programs like Blender. 
        <br>        <br>
        My scene is lit using one directional light and one ambient light, both can have their colour and intensity changed by a user through a GUI. 
        There are buttons to play the animation for a given model, set the current model to wireframe mode and then buttons for toggling a variety of
        effects. At the very top of the page is a model switching navigation bar.

        <!-- TESTING SECTION -->
        <h2 class="aboutPageSubTitles">Testing</h2>

        Testing involved handing a participant (entirely people from my house) the website, before standing back and simply observing. I explicitly provided no assistance or explanation of the website or the module.
        This was also typically conducted directly after doing testing for my Final Year Project, I do not believe this had any effect on the results but also believe it is worth noting regardless.
        <br>
        Testing primarily assisted in gauging the usability of the website (the previously discussed audio feedback additions were a result of this) but also had an effect on it's design. 
        Originally I decided on a less minimalist design approach but a common point of criticism I recieved was the lack of focus on the models. I ended up focusing on removing visual clutter, getting rid of 
        some unnecesarry explanation text and indents on the buttons.
