Below are backup links to my work:
General Github Link: https://github.com/AlexanderNoles/3DWA
Model Github Link: https://github.com/AlexanderNoles/3DWA/tree/master/modeling

There is some additional changes between the GitHub and the Live version, only the GitHub version works with the visual studio code live server addon.
